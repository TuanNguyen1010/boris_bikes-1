# Boris Bikes
An excercise in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Pair Programming.

The first Pair challenge for our cohort in Makers' Academy, we've been instructed to <i>"..build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality."</i>

# Wider Objectives:

## I can TDD anything
  <i>By the end of this week you should be able to write a meaningful test, based on the user requirements. You'll then be able to write code using TDD, to make the test pass.</i>

## I can program fluently
<i>You'll learn how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.</i>

## I can debug anything
<i>You'll be introduced to a technique for uncovering the root-cause of bugs in your code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to apply a consistent process to resolve the issue.</i>
